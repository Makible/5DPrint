5DPrint
=======
[ status - beta ]

5DPrint / fai·di·print / is tailor-made for the MakiBox A6 and modern 3D printing. 
The UI is designed for simplicity and letting the user get straight to printing. Devices are 
automatically detected and connected. Moving the extruder around has never been easier with 
the interactive print area.

5DPrint is a [Chrome App](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/webstore/apps-create.html) 
so no compilation is required. If you'd like to use the code outside of the Chrome webstore, you may
clone the git repo and install via `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developer Mode`.

Currently supports the MakiBox A6 (LT & HT) running the [MakiBox specific firmware](https://bitbucket.org/makible/makibox-firmware) 
living in bitbucket (__*Will soon port to github as well.*__).

For the [Go](http://golang.org/) implementation, please refer to [Go5D](https://github.com/Makible/Go5D) 
for more details.

__*MakiBox flavored G/MCode info, coming soon*__
